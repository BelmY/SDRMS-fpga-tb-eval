Simple tasks are used for having a similar design across all platforms. This helps to investigate the complexity required by each tool-chain to achieve the same task. For that reason a simple LED blinking task and a counter task was implemented. Small variations where introduced due to differences in the available development boards.

Project repository\cite{fpga-toolbox-eval-repo} is organised in per toolchain folders each containing implementation of the same task.

Under each tool-chain folder there is a LED\_Blink and SimpleCounter projects, these are the basic reference project for each evaluation. An additional GeekCounter project is included for devboards having 7-segment displays. Detailed information can be found on each project readme.md file
