Moving to a more advanced programming task, an LVDS transceiver was to be designed aiming in testing single device loop-back through LVDS as well as  inter-device communication using a single LVDS pair. Due to time restriction this task is partly implemented.

An LVDS project can be found for Quartus and Vivado in the respective LVDS-Quartus\cite{fpga-toolbox-eval-repo-lvds-quartus} and LVDS-Vivado\cite{fpga-toolbox-eval-repo=lvds-vivado} branches of the project repository
