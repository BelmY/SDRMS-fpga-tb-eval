The main scope of this activity is to act as a foundation for FPGA related sub-activities by testing available open source tool chains for FPGA programming with a selection of popular FPGA platforms.

Each tool chain will be evaluated against supported FPGA platforms in order to determine its capabilities. Focus is given on open source tool-chains while for platforms not yet supported by open source project, free or free license alternatives are explored.

During this process a basic set of FPGA programming tasks will be performed and evaluated. Simple tasks are used to evaluate tool chains on their simplest usage allowing the creation of common tasks across all the tool-chains. This will help evaluation by having a common reference design.
